EmotiSense - Bringing moods closer to friends
==============================================
Emotisense facilitates detection of a user's mood by sharing his pictures with his friends and allowing them to rate it using emoticons.   

How it works
=============
1.	The users subscribe to EmotiSense app via Facebook login. The App uses Facebook’s social graph to get information about the user and his friends. This information is sent to EmotiSense server that stores/updates user-friends mappings in case of a new/returning user.   

2.	After the successful login, every time a user unlocks their phone, the application will take an image. Once an image is captured, it is sent to EmotiSense server and stored in the database. It also stores the time when the image was taken for further analysis of a user's mood over the course of the day.  
  
3.	The user interface provided by the app allows user to check any of his friend’s profile or his own. If he chooses to see his friend’s profile, he first gets to see all the unrated pictures of that friend and rate them. The ratings are sent to the server on the basis of which the server determines the happiness quotient of that friend. If the user chooses to see his own profile, he can choose any of the 3 options – Daily analysis, Weekly analysis and Advanced analysis.  

4.	EmotiSense also allows users to share their happiness quotient on their Facebook walls.  
  
EmotiSense intends to kill that void of seamless capture and share the emotions with friends who opt for the service. It could be leveraged by any of the developers of social networks or other applications mentioned above. Specifically, it focusses on smartphone users who want to seamlessly share their moods (whether good or bad) without making any conscious effort. EmotiSense does real time emotion detection by capturing users moods by clicking their picture whenever they unlock their phones. As unlocking phones is an unconscious effort, therefore, it would also reduce false positives in mood detection.
